Global-scale investigations of biological diversity are 
becoming feasible as more and more species occurrence 
information, evolutionary relationships, and worldwide 
environmental data layers are becoming available.  The 
purpose of this class to explore broad-scale patterns in 
ecology and evolutionary biology and to learn how to 
acquire large-scale data sets for analysis of patterns 
and processes.  We will focus on methods of data 
accumulation and management from various public resources. 
Following each of those, we will be showing class 
participants how they can explore the data and take the 
steps necessary to form information and knowledge from
