Technical Notes
"Definition:"
"Bird species, number threatened, includes all species of birds that are listed as threatened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and that are known to occur in a given country. Threatened species data include species that are categorized as either ""Critically Endangered"", ""Endangered"", or ""Vulnerable."" Data include unconfirmed species occurrences and regionally extinct species, but exclude sub-species and introduced species."
""
"See the ""Methodology"" section below for further information."
""
"Years Covered and Frequency of Update:"
"This data set provides current threatened species data as of September 2007. Threatened species data are updated by IUCN on a continual basis as new data become available. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is typically published on an annual basis."
""
""
"Methodology:"
"Adapted from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Information Sources & Quality notes and 2001 Categories & Criteria (v. 3.1)."
""
"The information presented in the current IUCN Red List represents an accumulation of knowledge derived from previously published Red Lists, including the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals and The World List of Threatened Trees. In some cases assessments are the product of group discussion, but often they represent the judgment of individual Specialist Group members. In order to ensure greater accuracy and transparency in the listing process, a peer review system of Red List Evaluators was initiated. The intention of the system is that the assessments of all species on the Red List are scrutinized and evaluated by at least two people from a designated Red List Authority. The Red List Authorities are responsible for ensuring that all species they are responsible for are documented and re-assessed at regular intervals."
""
"Undescribed species are only included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species under certain specific conditions, including the undescribed taxon is in fact a good species, clear distribution information can be provided, and listing the undescribed species will potentially aid in its conservation."
""
""
"BirdLife International is the Red List Authority for birds and as such they have provided all the bird assessments used for the IUCN Red List. These assessments and the accompanying documentation reflect the information that appears on the World Bird Database developed and maintained by BirdLife International. Users are referred to the species accounts on the World Bird Database to see additional supporting data for all the bird listings and additional information on the data contributors and evaluation process for each species. "
""
"The nomenclature used for birds follows that provided by BirdLife International. BirdLife International maintains its own taxonomic list of all the world's bird species because there are so many different global, regional, national, site and family taxonomic checklists, and thus many differences of opinion over the taxonomic rank of certain taxa. For details about the BirdLife system see: http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/taxonomy.html. "
""
"A brief description of the IUCN system to assess risk of extinction is provided below. For more detailed information please refer to the original source at: http://www.redlist.org/info/categories_criteria2001.html."
""
"The IUCN classifies threatened species as ""all full species categorized at the global level as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable."" Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) taxon are considered to be facing an extremely high, very high, and high risk of extinction in the wild, respectively. For each threat category there are five criteria, A-E (see below), used to assess species status. Species need to meet the requirements in only one of the five criteria (A-E), according to the best available evidence, to be listed under that particular threat category."
""
"The five criteria are:"
"A - Reduction in population size"
"B - Reduction in geographic range"
"C - Population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 (CR), 2500 (EN), or 10000 (VU) mature individuals with continued declines in population anticipated"
"D - Population size is estimated to number fewer than 50 (CR), 250 (EN), or 1000 (VU) mature individuals"
"E - Quantitative analysis shows the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 50% within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer (CR), 20% within 20 years or five generations, whichever is longer (EN), or 10% within 100 years (VU)"
""
"In addition, there are sub-criteria which provide further information on the reasons to list a species in a particular category, potential causes of threat, etc."
""
"IUCN categorizes a species as ""Extinct"" if there is ""no reasonable doubt that the last individual [of that species] has died."" IUCN also categorizes a taxon as ""Extinct in the wild"", when ""it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity, or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range."""
""
"Data Reliability:"
"Threatened species assessments have been undertaken for 100% of all known bird species. The total number of threatened birds is an underestimate of the total number of threatened birds worldwide. Beyond the list of known birds, there are a number of undocumented species whose status is yet unknown. The number of known bird species, however, is believed to be better documented than other taxa."
""
"Where possible, standard world checklists have been used in order to promote nomenclatural stability. In a few instances Specialist Groups have used alternative systematic opinion and provided justification for doing so. Data on known species of mammals, birds, fish, molluscs, reptiles, amphibians, and plants are based on a compilation of available data from a large variety of sources, collected over the last decade. Additionally, while the number of species in each country does change, not all countries are updated systematically, and some data may not reflect recent trends."
