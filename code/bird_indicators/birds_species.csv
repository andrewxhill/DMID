Technical Notes
"Definition"
"Bird species, number refers to the total number of bird species that breed in a particular country, as well as those that migrate or winter there. A bird is defined as a ""warm-blooded egg-laying vertebrates characterized by feathers and forelimbs modified as wings."" "
""
"Both endemic and non-endemic species are included. Endemic species are those species whose distributions are naturally restricted to a defined region. Introduced (non-native) species may be included."
""
"Years Covered and Frequency of Updates"
"Species data maintained in the UNEP-WCMC Species Database is collected by the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC).  Data is updated on a continual basis as it becomes available.  The frequency of updates, however, varies between countries.  This dataset, obtained directly from UNEP-WCMC by WRI, contains the latest data as of September 2004."
""
""
"Methodology"
"The number of reported species is collected by UNEP-WCMC from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to: national reports from the convention on biodiversity, other national documents, independent studies, and other texts.  Data is updated on a continual basis as they become available; however, updates vary widely by country. "
""
"Data Reliability"
"The complete UNEP-WCMC dataset from which known species of mammals, birds, plants,"
"reptiles, and amphibians were extracted represents a small fraction of the actual number of"
"species that exist worldwide. The original UNEP-WCMC dataset contains records for 240,000 species"
"out of approximately 1.5 million species described globally (Meffe and Carroll 1997). The total actual"
"number of species worldwide is estimated to range from 10 million to 50 million or more (May 1988;"
"Wilson 1992). It is clear that at best, only about 2% of the total species of the world are represented"
"in the UNEP-WCMC Species Database. For this reason, it is important to recognize that numbers of"
"known species represented in this table are vast underestimates of the actual species worldwide."
"Mammals and birds are better known and represented than other taxonomic groups. "
""
"Data on known species of mammals, birds, plants, reptiles, and amphibians are based on a"
"compilation of available data from a large variety of sources. They are not based on species"
"checklists. Data have been collected over the last decade without a consistent approach to"
"taxonomy. Additionally, while the number of species in each country does change, not all countries"
"are updated systematically, and some data may not reflect recent trends."
