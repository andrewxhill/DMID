Technical Notes
"The total number of known species may include introductions in some instances. Total bird species listed includes only birds that breed in that country, not those that migrate or winter there. The number of endemic species refers to those species known to be found only within the country listed. Figures are not necessarily comparable among countries because taxonomic concepts and the extent of  knowledge vary (for the latter reason, country totals of species and endemics may be underestimates). In general, numbers of birds are fairly well known compared to other taxonomic groups. The number of threatened species listed for all countries includes full species that are categorized by IUCN as being critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. It excludes introduced species, species whose status is insufficiently known (categorized by IUCN as ""data deficient""(DD)), those known to be extinct, and those which status has not been assessed (categorized by IUCN as ""not evaluated""(NE)).  If a species is listed under the DD or NE categories - it should not be treated as a non-threatened species, but as one that has not been assessed. Threatened species data reflect estimates presented in the World Conservation Union (IUCN), 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals (IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, 1996). Birdlife International compiles and maintains the bird species section of the IUCN Red List. Threatened species data for birds are from Birds to Watch 2 (Collar, et al., 1994). The number of threatened species of birds are listed for countries included within their breeding or wintering ranges. The 1996 Red List of threatened Animals was the first time that all known mammal and bird species were assessed for threat. This was also the first time that the new IUCN categories and criteria were applied to assess the risk of extinction of species.  A brief description of the new system is presented below.  For more detailed information please refer to the original source. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies threatened species as ""all full species categorized at the global level as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable."" The definitions for these categories follow: a) Critically Endangered: ""When a taxon is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future as defined by any of the criteria A-E"" (defined below). b) Endangered: ""When a taxon is not Critically Endangered but is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future as defined by any of the criteria A-E."" c) Vulnerable: ""When a taxon is not Critically Endangered or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future as defined by any of the criteria A-E."" For each threat category there are five criteria A-E used to assess species status (see below).  This provides a more rigorous approach from that used prior to revisions of the IUCN criteria. Species need to meet only one of the five criteria (A-E) to be listed under that particular threat category.  The five criteria are: A- Declining population B- Small population and decline or fluctuation C- Small population size and decline D- Very small population/very restricted distribution E- Quantitative analysis (e.g. Population Viability Analysis) In addition, there are subcriteria which provide further information on the reasons to list a species, potential causes of threat, etc. Number of species per 10,000 square kilometers provides a relative estimate for comparing numbers of species among countries of differing size. Because the relationship between area and species number is nonlinear (i.e., as the area sampled increases, the number of new species located decreases), a species-area curve has been used to standardize these species numbers. The curve predicts how many species a country would have, given its current number of known species, if it was a uniform 10,000 square kilometers in size. This number is calculated using the formula for a species-area curve: S=c (A) elevated to ""z"", where, S= the number of species, A = area, and c  and z  are constants. The slope of the species-area curve is determined by the constant z , which is approximately 0.33 for large areas containing many habitats. This constant is based on data from previous studies of species-area relationships. In  reality, the constant z  would differ among regions and countries, because of differences in species range size (which tend to be smaller in the tropics) and differences in varieties of habitats present. A tropical country with a broad variety of habitats would be expected to have a steeper species-area curve than a temperate, homogenous country because one would predict a greater number of species per unit area. Species-area curves also are steeper for islands than for mainland countries. At present, there are insufficient regional data to estimate separate slopes for each country. IUCN categorizes a species as ""Extinct"" if there is ""no reasonable doubt that the last individual of that species has died."" IUCN also categorizes a taxon as ""Extinct in the wild"", when ""it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range.""
